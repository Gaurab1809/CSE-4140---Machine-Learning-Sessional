# 📤 How to Add Your Project to This Repository

Anyone from the course can upload their project, reports, or files to this repository by following the steps below.

---

## ✅ 1. Create Your Project Folder
Organize your project inside a single folder.  

Example:
```text
Your_Project_Name/
├── code/
├── dataset/
├── report.pdf
├── presentation.pdf
```
---
##### Place this folder anywhere on your computer.
---

## ✅ 2. Open Terminal / PowerShell Inside the Repository Folder

If this repository is already on your computer, open a terminal inside it:

```bash
cd path/to/CSE-4140---Machine-Learning-Sessional
```
## ✅ 3. Add the Remote Origin (Important)

If you downloaded ZIP or moved folders manually, set the remote to this repository:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Gaurab1809/CSE-4140---Machine-Learning-Sessional.git
```
If you get “remote origin already exists”, fix it:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Gaurab1809/CSE-4140---Machine-Learning-Sessional.git
```
Check remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```

## ✅ 4. Stage Your Changes
```bash
git add .
```
## ✅ 6. Commit Your Upload
```bash
git commit -m "Added my project: Your_Project_Name"
```
## ✅ 7. Push Your Files to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```
If pushing for the first time and branch doesn’t exist:
```bash
git branch -M main
```
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 💡 Important Rules

- Do not delete or overwrite others’ work
- Add your project inside Projects/
- Each project must include a **report, code file and presentation**.
- The report and the presentation should be in **pdf** format.
- **The code can be any in format you want (e.g. ipynb,text, docx, pdf etc.)**
- If you face permission issues, **ask the repository owner to add you as a collaborator.**
